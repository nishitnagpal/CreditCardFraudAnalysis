# Credit Card Fraud Analysis: A Data-Driven Approach
Digital payments are growing rapidly, but so are the threats from cybercriminals. With over 5 million records stolen daily, detecting fraudulent transactions has become increasingly challenging. This analysis leverages a Kaggle dataset of credit card transactions to explore patterns and parameters influencing fraud.

Key Insights:
Transaction Location:

Distance from home and the last transaction showed no clear correlation with fraud likelihood, making them unreliable indicators.
Transaction Value:

Ratios of purchase price to median values revealed no significant patterns linking high or low transaction values to fraud.
Retailer Correlation:

Approximately 88% of fraudulent transactions involved repeated retailers, highlighting the risk of frequent transactions with the same merchant.
Chip and PIN Usage:

Fraudulent transactions were significantly reduced with the use of chip (6.4%) and PIN (0.27%), demonstrating their effectiveness as fraud deterrents.
The combination of chip and PIN proved most secure, with fraudulent transactions dropping to a mere 0.009%.
Online vs. Offline Patterns:

Online transactions accounted for 95% of fraudulent cases, emphasizing the higher vulnerability of digital orders compared to in-store purchases.
Tools and Techniques:
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and XGBoost.
Methods: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SMOTE for handling imbalanced data, and GridSearchCV for model optimization.
The findings underscore the importance of robust authentication methods and cautious online payment practices to mitigate fraud risks.
